## Quecey's VOIP Library

This is a framework for making sip voice services like phone trees, synthesizers, sstv generators, and other experiments.

### Dev Environment

Getting your environment setup so you can develop your own phone experiment is fairly straightforward. The code is written so that you don't need to install PJSIP (the SIP library) to do local experiment programming.

You will need to install [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) for audio playback/recording to work. On debian/ubuntu, you can do this like so:

```sh
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
pip3 install PyAudio
# or if pip isn't available
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
```

For running/testing Dial-A-Song, you will also need `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` to be installed. On debian/ubuntu, you can do this like so:

```sh
sudo apt install ffmpeg
pip3 install yt-dlp
# or if pip isn't available
sudo apt install yt-dlp
```

Once you're done, you should be able to run the python script `test.py`, which will play some tones. After the tones, type the numbers "1234" into the terminal to hear "password correct."

For instructions on how to setup the voip library for running on a server that receives *actual* SIP calls, look at [server_setup.md](server_setup.md)

### API Documentation

Everything relevant to handling a call is in the "voip" module. The runVoipClient function starts a new (simulated) SIP client that uses a provided async function to deal with incoming calls. To end a call, simply return from the handler function early, or raise an unhandled exception.

#### Simple "Hello World"

Make a new file in this repo called "hello.py" and fill it with the following code:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from voip import runVoipClient

async def handler(call):
	await call.playTone(420, .5)
	await call.playTone(560, .5)
	await call.playTone(650, .5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	runVoipClient(handler)
```

The crux of this example is that when a new phone call comes in, your "handler" function will be called with a "call" object. This call object provides many methods, some of which are async (and therefore require you to "await" them) and some of which are not.

Running this script from the commandline will use the developer-only simulated SIP code, which will make a call right away. It should also recieve your microphone's input, which we will use later.

#### Enforcing one call at a time

By default the voip system will accept 10 simultaneous calls. However, you might not want to deal with the particularities of concurrent calls in your experiment. For example, saving/loading data might be problematic if multiple people can be in the experiment at the same time. If you only want your call to be available if no active call is currently using it, you can use the `one_at_a_time` decorator.

```py
from voip import one_at_a_time

@one_at_a_time
async def handler(call):
	# do stuff here...
```

#### Playing a custom sound

To play a custom sound, first you need to convert it to a 16-bit, 8000Hz WAV. You can use sox for this:

```sh
sox -V my_sound.mp3 -r 8000 -c 1 -t wav my_sound.wav
```

Place my_sound.wav in the "assets" folder of this directory. If you plan to make a lot, make a subdirectory with a unique name.

We can load our sound with loadWAVtoPCM, then play our sound using the playPCM method on the call object:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from voip import runVoipClient, loadWAVtoPCM

my_sound = loadWAVtoPCM("assets/my_sound.wav")

async def handler(call):
	await call.playPCM(my_sound)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	runVoipClient(handler)
```

The playPCM method takes a list of floats in the range [-1, 1] which represent the amplitude of the sound at 8000Hz. You can generate your own lists to play custom sounds, or use the playCustom method which will be covered later.

#### Getting keypad input

When a user presses a button on the keypad of their phone, it generates something called a "DTMF tone." These tones encode the particular key that was pressed. You can use the "getDTMF" method to get those keys.

```py
async def handler(call):
	# play a tone to signal to the user that we're accepting keypad input
	await call.playTone(1000, .25)
	key = await call.getDTMF()
	print(key)
```

This example will print out the key pressed, then end the call.

The getDTMF method has two option parameters. `n` allows you to specify how many keys to wait for, and `filter` allows you to specify a list of allowed keys. In the following example, we'll wait for 4 numeric digits.

```py
async def handler(call):
	await call.playTone(1000, .25)
	keys = await call.getDTMF(n=4, filter="1234567890")
	print(keys)
```

We can add a timeout by wrapping it in `asyncio.wait_for`. If the timeout triggers, it raises a TimeoutError. Be sure to import asyncio for this example to work.

```py
async def handler(call):
	await call.playTone(1000, .25)
	try:
		# wait for 4 numbers for max 60 seconds
		keys = await asyncio.wait_for(call.getDTMF(n=4, filter="1234567890"), 60)
	except TimeoutError:
		keys = "not enough keys pressed in the alloted time"
	print(keys)
```

You can also specify a lambda to run on the first digit pressed. This can be used to cancel a currently playing audio clip the moment a user hits a button when entering a multi-digit code. 

```py
async def handler(call):
	playback = call.playPCM(my_sound)
	keys = await call.getDTMF(n=4, filter="1234567890", on_first=lambda digit: playback.cancel())
	print(keys)
```

#### Recording audio

The call object has a "recordPCM" method. This returns a future which resolves to a list of floats, in the same format that playPCM expects. However, if you simply "await" on the method, it will never finish because it doesn't know how long it should record for.

To manage the duration of the recording, you need to import the RecordController object from the voip module. By passing an instance of it to recordPCM, you can stop the recording at any time by calling the stop method on the RecordController. Here is an example of recording audio until we get a DTMF key:

```py
from voip import runVoipClient, RecordController

async def handler(call):
	await call.playTone(1000, .25)
	# the RecordController lets us control when the recording should stop
	controller = RecordController()
	# start recording
	recorder = call.recordPCM(controller)
	# wait for a keypress
	key = await call.getDTMF()
	# stop recording
	controller.stop()
	# get the recording
	recording = await recorder
	# play it back
	await call.playPCM(recording)
```

#### Custom playback/recording methods

Sometimes you want to playback audio that you generate in realtime, or process incoming sounds one sample at a time. For example you might have some code that generates a song given the time. Another example is encoding the incoming audio with some codec for compression. For those usecases you'll want to use the playCustom or recordCustom methods on the call object.

Below is the source code for an echo client. This client recieves samples from recordCustom, adds them to a queue, which are then played using playCustom

```py
async def handler(call):
	sampleQueue = queue.Queue(maxsize=8000*2)
	stop = False
	def sampleInput(sample):
		# sample is the incoming audio sample
		if stop:
			# returning False stops the recording
			return False
		if not sampleQueue.full():
			# put the recieved sample into the queue
			sampleQueue.put(sample)
		# returning true continues the recording so this 
		# method will be called for the next incoming sample
		return True
	def sampleOutput(t, delta):
		# t is the time in seconds since playback started
		# delta is the time in seconds between subsequent calls
		if stop:
			# returning None stops the playback
			return None
		if sampleQueue.qsize() < 160:
			# return 0 if there aren't enough samples in the queue
			return 0
		# this pops the sample off the queue and returns it for playback
		return sampleQueue.get()
	# recordCustom takes a function that gets
	# called for each incoming audio sample
	call.recordCustom(sampleInput)
	# playCustom takes a function that gets called
	# every time a sample needs to be played
	call.playCustom(sampleOutput)
	# wait for a keypress
	await call.getDTMF()
```

#### Cancelling playback

One thing that one might want to do is play a sound but then do other things in the background. Here is an example:

```py
def handler(call):
	playback = call.playPCM(my_sound)
	# wait for a keypress
	key = await call.getDTMF()
	# once we get it, cancel the playing sound
	playback.cancel()
	if key == '1':
		await do_thing_for_one(call)
	else:
		await do_thing_for_other(call)
```

With this in mind, you can use the "loop" optional parameter on playPCM to play the sound continuously in a loop, then do `playback.cancel()` to stop it when you want.

#### Text-to-speech

Text to speech is provided by espeak or rhvoice. To install them, use:

```sh
sudo apt install espeak-ng-espeak rhvoice rhvoice-english
# for extra voices
sudo apt install mbrola mbrola-en1 mbrola-us1 mbrola-us2 mbrola-us3
```

You can then use the TTStoPCM method in the "tts" module:

```py
from voip.tts import TTStoPCM

def handler(call):
	await call.playPCM(TTStoPCM("this is a test of speech to text"))
```

This works by forking out a subprocess that handles the TTS and its stdout. There are two engines: espeak and rhvoice. You can specify which one you want with the `engine` optional parameter, by default it is espeak. You can pass your own arguments to the subprocess like so:

```py
def handler(call):
	await call.playPCM(TTStoPCM("this is a test of speech to text",
		engine="rhvoice",
		opts=["-p", "slt"]
	))
```
